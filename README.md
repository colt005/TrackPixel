## About The Project

A GoLang REST API server for creating and tracking email pixel tracker images. 

### Built With
* [Go](https://go.dev/)
* [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
* [QuestDB](https://questdb.io/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Go
* QuestDB
* PostgreSQL (To connect to QuestDB using PSQL wire protocol)
* Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/colt005/thumbify.git
```
2. Download and install [Quest DB](https://questdb.io/get-questdb/), then run it locally or deploy it on a server. 

3. Set up environment variables
```sh
export PORT=<Port you want to run the server on>
export BASE_URL=<Base url of the server use `http://localhost$PORT` if running locally>
export CONN_STRING=<Connection url of the PSQL wire protocol which questDB exposes. If the QuestDB is running locally it will be `postgresql://admin:quest@localhost:8812/qdb` >
